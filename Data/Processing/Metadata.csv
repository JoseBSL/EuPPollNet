Sampling method of survey is 6 minuts per plant species. All plant species where sampled
for equal time period. All floral visitors were collected.
We determined the total number of flowers or inflorescences (fower units)
per plant species in 1-m2 areas located at 1-m intervals along the two 50 m transects.
Flower unit description is defined as the distance that a small bee (c. 1 cm length)
would fly, rather than walk (Saville 1993). For example, in the Asteraceae, a flower
unit is the entire inflorescence while in the Rosaceae, a flower unit is a single flower.

It consists of plant-pollinator networks in 12 different landscapes

Transects were stratified in relation with the area of each type of pollinator habitat
within a 500 m radius around the centroid. Habitat is given for each individual catch,
not for the landscape as a whole. Transect length and duration are therefore pooled in
this file, rather than giving the sampling time in each habitat
(in total: 120 min per site visit, so 360 min in total, if the networks are pooled
over the 3 sampling periods). If requested, we can also provide sampling time from
each subtransect in different habitat types.",NA

11_Clough,Dataset_description,"This dataset documents 18 different sites in southernmost Sweden
(Scania) along a gradient of landscape scale land-use composition.
The focal habitat are Fennoscandian lowland species-rich dry to mesic grasslands.
In each site a pair of 3x3 m study plots were established in temporary (April to August)
5x9m cattle exclosures (electric fence). One plot was subjected to pollinator reduction
treatment and is not included here. The control plot is completely open and it is the data
from those plots that are inlcuded here. Three to four visits to each site were performed,
and in each visit we measured both plant-pollinator interactions and flower abundance. 
Each visit contained a period of 15 minutes where flower visitors were caught for
species-level identification. It is this data that is being contributed here, including the 
observations of insects that were not caught (unintentionally or because identification in the
field was possible). All floral visitors are included. Two years of data are available
(3 visits in 2020 and 4 in 2021). A data paper and several manuscripts are in preparation
where this data is used. A DOI for the dataset is forthcoming. As co-authors in sheet 3
are listed the three persones responible for the conception,
design and part of the data collection, quality control and curation. Other signficant
contributions are by the Lund Biological Museum staff that identified most of the
collected material (Rune Bygebjerg, Christoffer Fägerström, Christer Hansson, Karin Johnson,
Jadranka Rota, Ellen Sandström) and the field assistants that contributed to data recording
(Adam Bates, Sandra Blasiussion, Karlis Kenklis, Mirela Miric, Alessandro Pinto).
Uncertainty/ambiguity in species id is marked by use of slash in the case of species groups
(e.g. for some of the bumblebees) or a vertical bar whenever a subset of individuals
observed were caught for later identification and more than one species was found
(commonly for pollen beetles). Elevation data is from GSD-Höjddata grid 50+ from Lantmäteriet.

received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s

39_Schweiger,Dataset_description,"This dataset was generated within the VOODOO project
  and documents 16 different landscapes in agricultural and urban areas of Central Germany.
  We followed a landscape-level approach, where a site is defined by a 1km radius.
  Within each site we placed transects on a stratified random basis in each of present habitat types.
  The total length of the transect was 1km per site, but split according to the relative proportions of the different habitat types.
  If multiple patches of a particular habitat type were present,
  transects can occur in different patches per habitat typ.
  Three sampling rounds were undertaken to cover the full activity period of pollinators.
  During each sampling round, flower densities were assessed per species with multiple plots of 1 sqm.
  The number of plots depended on the length of the respective transect.
  Flower densities were calculated as average across all pllots per transect.
  Except for Asteraceae, single flowers were counted.
  In case you need flower units, we can provide this.
  The nested sampling structure is reflected in the Site code:
  Site_habitat type_transect ID. 
  With this you can aggregate per landscape or per habitat type per landscape.
  Note: the location of the transect was adjusted to the management and flower availability.
  Thus, the IDs for habitat and transect are in some cases not constant across the three sampling rounds.
  As a second identifyer, particularly for linking network and flower data, you need the sampling round.
  This is coded in the comments column (rounds 1,2,3) as I did not want to mess up the structure of the template.",NA
