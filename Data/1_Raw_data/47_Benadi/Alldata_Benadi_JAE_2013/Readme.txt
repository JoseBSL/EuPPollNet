This data set consists of the following tables:
1) Flower visits
2) Flower areas
3) Flower morphology
4) Plant species list
5) Insect species list
6) Networks
7) Weather


Details on each table:

1) Flower visits
Contains the bulk of the data, 10504 flower visits. In addition to the species identities of the visitor (column "Insect_species") and the plant ("Plant_species"), the table provides information on the date and time of the recording, the observer (GB, LM or SN) and the plot on which the observation was made. Plots are numbered from 1 (lowest altitude) to 6 (highest altitude). See the supplementary file of the article for precise locations and altitudes of these plots. In addition, each observation is assigned to one of 68 plant-pollinator networks ("Network_no", numbered 1-69, no. 15 does not exist). Normally, a network consisted of all interactions observed at a single date and plot, but in a few cases observations of two consecutive days were lumped. In these cases bad weather prevented us from sampling for at least six hours on a single day, so we continued sampling on the next day.

2) Flower areas
Area (in m² per m² ground) of flowers per species and network. For each of the plant-pollinator networks mentioned above, the area covered by flowers of each plant species was estimated by counting flowers (or flowering units) in quadrats, measuring the diameter of a selection of flowers and converting flower counts to area by assuming a circular shape. See the main article and supplementary material for more details. Note that no flower areas are available for interaction networks 67 and 69.

3) Flower morphology
Morphological measurements taken from 1-10 flowers of each plant species. These include:
* Diameter (mm; for zygomorphic flowers, mean of width and height)
* LN: Length (mm) of the nectar holder tube
* DN1: Width (mm) of nectar holder tube at entrance
* DN2: Width (mm) of nectar holder tube at base
* Unit: Single flower (S), Composite (C) or Flowering unit (FU). Strongy compact inflorescences such as those of Asteraceae were counted as one and noted as C. Inflorescences with clearly separated flowers (so that a visitor would usually need to fly from one flower to the next) were noted as FU. For FU, the number of flowers per unit (column "Flowers_per_unit") was counted for a number of inflorescences.
See Stang et al. (2006, Oikos) for the definition of a nectar holder tube and its length.
For a number of rarely observed flowering plants (SampleID 1003-1022), we were unable to take morphological measurements of the flowers. We therefore used diameters provided in the following book:
D. Aichele, H.-W. Schwegler (ed.) 2000: Die Blütenpflanzen Mitteleuropas. Frankh-Kosmos-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany.
For undetermined Asteraceae (of which only a single individual was observed) we used the mean of all identified Hieracium, Crepis and Leontodon species as an estimate of the flower diameter.

4) Plant species list
List of species and family names of all 166 flowering plant species included in the study. In addition, the table lists flower colours and flower types after Kugler. The nomenclature, flower colours and types were taken from the "Biolflor" data base (http://www2.ufz.de/biolflor/index.jsp).

5) Insect species lists
List of species names, families and orders of all insect species that could be identified to species level.

6) Networks
List of plant-pollinator networks, with observer identity, plot and total observation time.

7) Weather
Temperature (°C) and humidity (%) recorded by a mobile weather station placed in the shade while recording plant-pollinator interactions.
