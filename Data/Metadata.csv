1_Bartomeus,Dataset_description,"Study site at Cap de Creus, Catalonia, Spain.
Sampling method of survey is 6 minuts per plant species. All plant species where sampled
for equal time period. All floral visitors were collected.
We determined the total number of flowers or inflorescences (fower units)
per plant species in 1-m2 areas located at 1-m intervals along the two 50 m transects.
Flower unit description is defined as the distance that a small bee (c. 1 cm length)
would fly, rather than walk (Saville 1993). For example, in the Asteraceae, a flower
unit is the entire inflorescence while in the Rosaceae, a flower unit is a single flower.
Networks where only sampled April to June for Carpobrotus and June/July for Opuntia,
Sites are invaded or non invaded, and 50*50m; situated at least 300 m apart."

Greece. The purpose of the samplings was to study post-fire succession
of plant-pollinator system so we have included data from two sites that
they were burnt three years before sampling. The remaining four sites
are unburnt scrublands with two of them being in the margins of cultivations
(olive grove and mastic trees). Each year 3 visits to each site
were performed and in each visit we measured both plant-pollinator

across the whole elevational range distribution of Buddleja davidii (100-1200 m a.s.l.),
our target exotic plant species. For each pair, we chose one site invaded and one
non-invaded by B. davidii. Sites were open riparian habitats located along valley bottoms.
Within each pair, the surrounding landscape and plant community composition were similar.
Sites were visited five times between June and August 2018. At each visit, each flowering
species was sampled for 5 minutes, so the time spent at each site depended on the number
of flowering plant species. The Interaction column in the Interaction_data sheet indicates
the number of specimens observed on each plant species. The Flower_count column in the

pollinators at the landscape scale, we placed a grid of 600 m x 600 m on each landscape.

It consists of plant-pollinator networks in 12 different landscapes
(4 agricultural, 4 rural, 4 urban), sampled over 3 periods in 2021
(mid april, end may and mid july). Coordinates are the centroids of each landscape.
Transects were stratified in relation with the area of each type of pollinator habitat
within a 500 m radius around the centroid. Habitat is given for each individual catch,
not for the landscape as a whole. Transect length and duration are therefore pooled in
this file, rather than giving the sampling time in each habitat
(in total: 120 min per site visit, so 360 min in total, if the networks are pooled
over the 3 sampling periods). If requested, we can also provide sampling time from
each subtransect in different habitat types."

11_Clough,Dataset_description,"This dataset documents 18 different sites in southernmost Sweden
(Scania) along a gradient of landscape scale land-use composition.
The focal habitat are Fennoscandian lowland species-rich dry to mesic grasslands.
In each site a pair of 3x3 m study plots were established in temporary (April to August)
5x9m cattle exclosures (electric fence). One plot was subjected to pollinator reduction
treatment and is not included here. The control plot is completely open and it is the data
from those plots that are inlcuded here. Three to four visits to each site were performed,
and in each visit we measured both plant-pollinator interactions and flower abundance. 
Each visit contained a period of 15 minutes where flower visitors were caught for
species-level identification. It is this data that is being contributed here, including the 
observations of insects that were not caught (unintentionally or because identification in the
field was possible). All floral visitors are included. Two years of data are available
(3 visits in 2020 and 4 in 2021). A data paper and several manuscripts are in preparation
where this data is used. A DOI for the dataset is forthcoming. As co-authors in sheet 3
are listed the three persones responible for the conception,
design and part of the data collection, quality control and curation. Other signficant
contributions are by the Lund Biological Museum staff that identified most of the
collected material (Rune Bygebjerg, Christoffer Fägerström, Christer Hansson, Karin Johnson,
Jadranka Rota, Ellen Sandström) and the field assistants that contributed to data recording
(Adam Bates, Sandra Blasiussion, Karlis Kenklis, Mirela Miric, Alessandro Pinto).
Uncertainty/ambiguity in species id is marked by use of slash in the case of species groups
(e.g. for some of the bumblebees) or a vertical bar whenever a subset of individuals
observed were caught for later identification and more than one species was found
(commonly for pollen beetles). Elevation data is from GSD-Höjddata grid 50+ from Lantmäteriet.
Funding statement: The data was recorded under the project DrivenByPollinators, which
received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s
Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 819374)."

  in the Northern Swiss lowlands (8 sites along a
  landscape simplification gradient, 4 urban sites)
  of 1 km radius (min. 1.5 km apart). In each
  landscape, wild bees and syrphids were sampled along
  transects in flowering habitat types (habitat type
  categories according to EUNIS habitat types, aggregation 2 level).
  A 1 km transect (2 m wide) was divided into sections proportional
  to the amount of these different flowering habitat types
  in the core (500 m radius) of a landscape (= different
  focal habitats within each site; stratified random sampling).
  We placed these tansect sections randomly in different patches
  of the corresponding habitat types in each landscape
  (including flowering crops). Three sampling rounds
  in April, May/June and July were conducted in each landscape,
  adjusting the location and length of transects in each round
  according to the proportion and location of flowering habitats.
  The transect walks were standardized so that 3 min were used for
  recording flower visiting bees and syrphids and their visited
  flower for each 25 m sub-section, pausing the clock for catching
  and processing the samples. "
