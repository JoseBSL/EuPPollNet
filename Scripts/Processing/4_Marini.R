across the whole elevational range distribution of Buddleja davidii (100-1200 m a.s.l.),
our target exotic plant species. For each pair, we chose one site invaded and one
non-invaded by B. davidii. Sites were open riparian habitats located along valley bottoms.
Within each pair, the surrounding landscape and plant community composition were similar.
Sites were visited five times between June and August 2018. At each visit, each flowering
species was sampled for 5 minutes, so the time spent at each site depended on the number
of flowering plant species. The Interaction column in the Interaction_data sheet indicates
the number of specimens observed on each plant species. The Flower_count column in the
Flower_availability sheet indicates the percentage cover of the species in the total
site area.",
