Dataset_description = "This dataset documents 6 different sites in Chios Island
Greece. The purpose of the samplings was to study post-fire succession
of plant-pollinator system so we have included data from two sites that
they were burnt three years before sampling. The remaining four sites
are unburnt scrublands with two of them being in the margins of cultivations
(olive grove and mastic trees). Each year 3 visits to each site
were performed and in each visit we measured both plant-pollinator
interactions and flower abundance. All samplings were performed during
the period that most pollinators are active and most plants are flowering
(April â€“ End of June). We have included data of one year of sampling
but two more years are available.",

Hymenoptera (with the exception of Formicidae), Diptera
